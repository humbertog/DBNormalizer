The program is divided into 3 modules. The reason for this is the separation of concerns. We followed the model view controller pattern:
1) Model: Contains all the functions, classes and methods used to perform the decomposition, generating SQL statements, get functional dependencies, read metadata from db, etc.
2) Controller:  This acts as an interface between the view and the model.
3) View: This contains GUI code.
